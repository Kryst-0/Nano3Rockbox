# Rockbox for the iPod Nano 3G

Run [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org/) — the open-source music firmware — on
the **iPod Nano 3rd generation** (the "fat" Nano, 2007, model N46). This is a
community port with a simple Windows app that installs it for you.

> ⚠️ **Installing replaces Apple's software.** It reformats the iPod's storage,
> which removes Apple's OS and everything on the device. You can go back to
> Apple later ([here's how](port-docs/GOING_BACK_TO_APPLE.md)), but it needs
> iTunes. Back up your music first.

## Is my iPod supported?

You need an **iPod Nano 3rd generation**. It shipped in **4 GB and 8 GB**
capacities and both are supported. Not sure which iPod you have? It's the
short, wide one with a 2-inch screen, from 2007.

Not every Nano 3G can run this yet: it depends on the exact flash memory chip
inside, which varies between units (capacity does not decide it). The app has a
**"Check my iPod (safe)"** button that reads the chip and tells you — it never
writes anything, so it is safe to run on any unit.

Validated configurations currently include specific Hynix, Micronas, Toshiba
and Intel parts across 4 GB and 8 GB units. Some IDs are safe only with the
tested chip-enable count, so do not decide from maker or capacity alone. See
the [chip compatibility table](port-docs/CHIP_COMPATIBILITY.md) and always run
the safe check before installing.

### Toshiba MB249 and fast boot

The Toshiba `98 D5 85 A5 EA 12 02 00` part used by an 8 GB MB249 unit has
now been erase/program/read-back validated on all four chip enables. The FTL
also verifies mapped blocks on first access instead of reading every populated
page during every boot. On the hardware-tested unit with about 4 GB of music,
startup dropped from roughly 20 minutes to roughly 20 seconds while retaining
torn-write recovery. See [Fast boot and MB249 validation](port-docs/NANO3G_MB249_FAST_BOOT.md)
for the design, tests, upgrade steps, rollback procedure and limitations.

## Get the app

Download the latest installer from the
[Releases page](../../releases), or build it yourself
([instructions](port-docs/BUILDING.md)).

It is a single Windows program — nothing else to install. Right-click it and
choose **Run as administrator** (it needs that to access the iPod's storage).

---

## Using the app

The app has three buttons. It talks you through each step in its log window and
waits for you, so you don't have to time anything by hand.

Before starting:

1. Back up all music and any other files on the iPod.
2. Connect the iPod directly to the computer rather than through a USB hub.
3. Close iTunes and iTunesHelper so they cannot take control during DFU.
4. Run the installer as Administrator and use **Check my iPod (safe)** first.
5. Install only when the checker reports the exact NAND identity and topology
   as validated. A similar-looking chip ID is not sufficient.

On Windows, DFU (`05AC:1223`) must be accessible to `mks5lboot`. If the app
cannot open it, bind **WinUSB** to the DFU device with Zadig. Do not replace the
normal Rockbox USB-storage driver: storage mode (`05AC:127F`) uses Windows' own
USB mass-storage driver. See
[Windows USB driver compatibility](port-docs/USB_DRIVER_COMPATIBILITY.md).

### 1. Check my iPod (safe)

Reads the flash chip and reports whether your unit is supported. **Read-only —
nothing is written.** Always start here.

### 2. Install Rockbox

Installs Rockbox. When prompted, put the iPod into **DFU mode** by keeping it
plugged in and holding **MENU + SELECT** until the screen goes black. The app
detects DFU automatically and continues on its own: it formats the iPod, copies
Rockbox across, and installs the bootloader. When it finishes, the iPod reboots
into Rockbox.

> This erases the iPod completely, including Apple's software. See the warning
> at the top.

### Updating an existing Nano3Rockbox installation

Do not format or erase NAND merely to install the fast-boot build. If the iPod
already uses Nano3Rockbox's on-flash format, update `.rockbox/rockbox.ipod` and
`rockbox-info.txt`, safely unmount the volume, then test the matching bootloader
as a RAM-only DFU image before installing it into NOR. The complete guarded
procedure, commands, hashes and rollback steps are in
[MB249 validation and fast boot](port-docs/NANO3G_MB249_FAST_BOOT.md#updating-an-existing-nano3rockbox-installation).

Never use Rockbox Utility's iPod Classic target to install the firmware or
bootloader; that compatibility applies only to themes and fonts.

### 3. Uninstall (restore Apple)

Removes Rockbox and erases the storage so you can restore Apple's software with
iTunes. The app walks you through it; when it's done, open iTunes and restore
the iPod. Full details: [Going back to Apple's OS](port-docs/GOING_BACK_TO_APPLE.md).

### Entering DFU mode

Whenever the app asks: keep the iPod plugged in and hold **MENU + SELECT**
until the screen goes completely black. That's DFU mode. You don't need to
unplug anything.

## What it looks like

The two main workflows in the app: installing Rockbox, and restoring the iPod
back to Apple's software.

## Adding themes and fonts

Once Rockbox is installed and the iPod boots it, you can use the official
[Rockbox Utility](https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/RockboxUtility) to download and
install extra **themes** and **fonts** onto the device.

The Nano 3G is not in Rockbox Utility's device list, but the installed firmware
is compatible with the iPod Classic (6th gen) target for theme and font
installation. So:

1. In Rockbox Utility, select **iPod Classic (6th gen)** as your device.
2. Point it at the iPod's drive and install the themes/fonts you want.
3. It will warn you with a **"Target mismatch detected"** dialog (shown below)
   because you picked the Classic target on a Nano 3G. This is expected —
   click **OK** to continue.

![Rockbox Utility target-mismatch warning: "Problem detected: Target mismatch detected. Selected target: Ipod Classic (6th gen). Continue with installation?"](port-docs/images/rockbox-utility-target-mismatch.png)

Only use this for **themes and fonts**. Do not use Rockbox Utility to install
the bootloader or the main firmware on the Nano 3G — those are handled by the
app on this page, and the Classic target's versions are not correct for this
device.

## Status

Rockbox boots and runs on real hardware: it plays music, the UI works, and the
device round-trips files reliably over USB. This is a community work in
progress, not an official Rockbox release, and it is provided as-is. Known
limitations and design tradeoffs are covered in
[How storage works](port-docs/FTL_DESIGN.md).

## Credits

This port stands on a large body of existing work — Rockbox itself and its
S5L8702 platform support, earlier community Nano 3G efforts, and the
[freemyipod / wInd3x](https://github.com/freemyipod/wInd3x) project whose DFU
exploit makes running unsigned bootloaders possible.

Thanks also to **Andrew Rice** for reverse-engineering and documentation of the
iPod Nano 3G platform that helped inform this port.
